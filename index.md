## React Shared Lib Components (React + Storybook + JEST + Babel)

This project was created with the intention of helping other developers to create their own application of shared components with an updated plugin base.

### How to use

It's quite simple, just install the package inside your project:

```shell
npm install @matheusslg/shared-lib-components
```

And then inside a component in your project:

```js
  import React from 'react';
  import { MyFirstComponent } from '@matheusslg/shared-lib-components';

  const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
      <MyFirstComponent />
    )
  }

  export default MyComponent;
```
